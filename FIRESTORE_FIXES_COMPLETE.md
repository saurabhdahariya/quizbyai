## 🔧 **SPECIFIC FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. User Document Management**
```javascript

   - Check if user document exists
   - Create document with setDoc() if missing
   - Update existing document with updateDoc()
   - Graceful error handling (quiz creation continues even if user update fails)

✅ User Document Structure:
   {
     uid: "user_id",
     email: "user@example.com",
     name: "User Name",
     role: "student",
     quizzesCreated: 1,
     quizzesTaken: 0,
     averageScore: 0,
     createdAt: timestamp,
     updatedAt: timestamp
   }
```

### **2. Function Parameter Fixes**
```javascript
✅ Fixed Functions:
   - getAIQuizzes(limitCount = 20)
